# Outpatient-Clinic-Simulation
A simulation for a clinic to calcualte the working costs under given constraints.
Introduction-:


Busy Healthcare facilities constantly face challenges due to the substantial increase in patient flow, costs associated with care providing to those patients and budget constraints. In order to aid decision-makers best utilize the available resources, application of modeling and simulation to the hospital operation was used to evaluate the efficiency of current strategy and predict the result of any future changes that might be applied to the system.
 
Models are mathematical frameworks that choose to represent some aspects of reality at a sufficient level of detail to facilitate estimation of the consequences of health care decisions and allow complex systems to be simplified to its essential elements. Models are considered essential tools in health technology assessment. 
Simulation of a system is the computer based operation of a model, it makes it possible to study system properties, operating characteristics, evaluate different operational strategies, draw conclusions and make action decisions based on the results of the simulation before the actual implementation of the strategy is performed. It is useful tool that guides improvement of existing resources utilization strategy and assist in planning and designing new strategies based on data gathering and information technology.
 
Modeling process can be broadly divided into two distinct components:
1-Conceptualization of the problem:
Transform knowledge of the health care process into a simplified problem representation
2-Conceptualization of the model:
Direct the selection of modeling technique that satisfy needs of problem under investigation.
Moreover, nature of the problem under investigation, the target population, time horizon over which outcomes are represented, and the project objectives have substantial impact on model structure, required data to populate it, analytic perspective, and model reporting.
The experts in the health care system play a considerable role in problem conceptualization and developing model specifications. Initial conceptualization of the problem should provide a complete picture of the problem and not restricted by data availability. The Impact of missing or poor data quality on model structure should be evaluated through sensitivity analyses.
